# ML-jobs-Scraping ( beautiful soup )
* **scraping machine learning jobs from indeed.com**

### how it works:

> **This tool was built to scrape ML-job posting data from indeed.com.
The first block of code has imports for the required libraries,
and also asks for a vocation and also a location. 
If you enter a location, you need to change the commented out portion of code in the second block.
Once you have entered a location,the code will scrape the first 600 jobs
posted on indeed (location, company, title, and a link)**
